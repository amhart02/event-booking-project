## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Make the app more realistic by adding events that might actually correlate to one another
* [ ] Make the events to be checked off more in depth with a description, time, and maybe a picture
* [ ] Add more detail overall and make it more esthetically pleasing.
